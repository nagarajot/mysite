      Mysore (or Mysuru), a city in India's southwestern Karnataka state, was
      the capital of the Kingdom of Mysore from 1399 to 1947. In its center is
      opulent Mysore Palace, seat of the former ruling Wodeyar dynasty. The
      palace blends Hindu, Islamic, Gothic and Rajput styles. Mysore is also
      home to the centuries-old Devaraja Market, filled with spices, silk and
      sandalwood.
