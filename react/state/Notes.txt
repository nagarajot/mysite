props is a way of infuencing what is rendered on the screen.

there is a second way, i.e. state.

props vs state
----------------------------------------------------
props gets passed to a component        state is managed within the component

function parameters                     variables declared within the component

props are immutable.                    component has full control over state
props are owned by parents.             state can be changed
so, it cannot be changed in child.

props - Functional components           usestate hook in functional components       
this.props in class components          this.state in class components

both props and state influences what is rendered on the screen.

state is an object, maintained privately in the class.
use setState() to update the state.
