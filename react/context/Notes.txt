need for context api ?

             App 

  A           B           C 

              D           E 

                          F 

Nested components.
Max 3 levels.

A,D,F to display loged in user name.
userName is maintained in App component.
We have to pass the username as a prop.

Component A, no problem, pass it as props.

For component D, we have an intermediate component B.
Pass props to B, then from B pass as props to D.

Pass the props to C, E and F.

Components B, C and E do not need the props.
But, still we have to pass the info thru them.
Components in between have to forward the props.

lang preference
UI theme
Athenticated userName

are generally required at various components at various levels.

It is better, if you can directly send the data to the required components,
without drilling the props thru the components.

This is where context comes into picture.

Context provides a way to pass data through the component there
without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Implment a user context, which will help to exract the prop
at any level.

App
CompA 
CompB 
CompC 

In App.js wrap Component with UserProvider.

<UserProvider>
    <CompA />
</UserProvider>
