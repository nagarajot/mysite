lists and keys
-----------------------

ListMoviesFC.js     key is used as prop, no warning in console
ListTVsFC.js        key is accessed in child, warning in console
                    key prop is reserved, we should not use it to render any data

                    What is the use of key?
                    It helps react to identify which items in the list have changed,
                    or added or removed.
                    It plays a crucial role in handling updates to DOM efficiently.
                    
                    Key give the element a stable identity.

                    Suppose, if our list is not having any unique id.
                    What is to be done.

                    Discussed in IndexAsKeyAntiPattern.

                    When to use index as a key ?
                    - the items in the list do not have a unique id
                    - the list is a static list and it will not change
                    - the list will never be re ordered and filtered
