Fragments lets you group a list of children elements,
without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

JSX expressions should have one parent element.

If you want to return 2 elements, then you need to wrap the elements
in another parent element namely <div>.

Key attribute is the only atribute that can be passed to the Fragment.
