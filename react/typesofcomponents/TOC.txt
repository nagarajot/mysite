Functional Vs Class Components
-------------------------------------------------------------

Simple functions                     More feature rich           

Use functional comps as far as       Maintain their own private 
possible                             date called as state.

Absence of this keyword.             Handle complex UI logic

Solution without using state.        Provide lifecycle hooks

Mainly responsible for the UI.       Also called as statefull/smart/
                                     container component.
It is also called as stateless/
dumb/presentation component.

React hooks introduced in React 

Ver 16.7 20-dec-2018

Contradicts what is learnt in class vs functional components.

Hooks are a new feature, which lets you use state and other
react features without writing a class.

Both state and life cycle methods may be used in functional components.

Hooks 

- no breaking changes
- completely optional and 100% backward compatable.

Therefore 2 types of components.
1. Functional components
2. Class components

Use state, life ycle methods and this binding in class components.
