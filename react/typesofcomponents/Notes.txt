Components are a part of UI.

UI has 5 Components

------------------------------------
          Header
-------------------------------------
Sidebar               Main content
-------------------------------------
           Footer
-------------------------------------

All these components are placed inside a root component called
as app component.

Components are reusable.
Same componeent may be used with diff props to display diff infr.
Components may contain other componenets.
App component contains other components.

Component code is placed in a JS file.
App Component is placed in App.js.

2 types.

Stateless functional component.
Stateful class component.

Stateless functional components
--------------------------------
They are JS functions.
They return HTML which describes the UI.

function fn()
{
    return <h1>Hello World</h1>    
}


Stateful class component
----------------------------

They are regular ES6 class which extends Component class
from react library.

Contains a render method which returns HTML.

class Welcome extnds Component
{
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello World</h1>
    }
}

What is the diff between class components and functional components ?
When to use what ?

Facebook has over 30,000 components.
Complex applications will have more no of components.


Summary:
- Components describe a part of UI.
- Reusable and can be nested inside other components.
- 2 types 
   * stateless functional components 
   * stateful class components
- Components are the building blocks of any react applications

Functional components
---------------------

Functional components are just JS functions.
They can optionally accept properties(props).
It returns HTML(JSX).

Properties(props) ---->  JS fn  -----> HTML(JSX)

Class components
----------------

Class components are ES6 classes.
Optionally receives props as input and outputs HTML(JSX).

Class component can have its own internal state.
It can maintain some private information.


properties(props)   ----->    ES6 fn  ----->   HTML(JSX)
                              state
