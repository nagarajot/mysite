    Duplication of names Bob
    Warning in console

    Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `Bob`. 
    Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. 
    Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” 
    the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
