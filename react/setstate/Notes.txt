setState
--------

this.state.count = this.state.count + 1
UI is not rendered.
But the value changes in the console.

Therefore always use setState() method, to update value of state.
React will update the DOM.

Whenever you want to update the prevState, pass a fn to setState.
2 parameter to useState is props.
(prevState, props)


Summary :
--------
1. Always make use of setState and never modify the state directly.

2. Code has to e executed after the state has been updated, place the 
   code in the callback fn, which is the second argument to the setState() method.

3. When you have to update state, based on the previous state value, 
   pass in a fn as an argument, instead of regular object.
